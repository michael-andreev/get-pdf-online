Before build the Installer you need to do some manual tasks that haven't been automatized yet:
1) Publish PrecizeSoft.GetPdfOnline.Web.SpaApp to folder using specified Publish Profile
2) Extract LibreOfficePortable 5.3.7 to folder Temp\LO (Don't know why, but portable versions 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 doesn't work)
3) Copy Node.exe (x86) to folder Temp
